#                        Task 1: 3D Printing

Through this task, I was able to understand the fundamentals and requirements of a 3D printer. The printer I used for this task was the **Ender 3 printer**. The conditions were as follows:
* Filament: PLA(PolyLactic Acid)
* Bed plate temperature: 60 degrees Celsius
* Extruder temperature: 200 degrees Celsius
* Infill density: 15 %
I downloaded the stl(stereolithography) file of a *3d Benchy* from thingiverse. Then using Ultimaker Cura, slicing was done and the file was print ready.

->Here is a small clip of the 3D printer:

* Understood that API’s function similar to waiters at a restaurant( an interesting analogy) where they transmit requests from the host to servers and databases and return the desired output based on host input
* Was able to successfully code and execute a weather app

#                        Task 4: Familiarising with Ubuntu

Doing this task, I learnt basic commands for the command line on ubuntu. I dirst created a directory called testrehan. Then, I opened that directory. In that directory, i created a file named *blankfile.txt*. Following this, i created 2600 directories in the directory testrehan and listed them all.
Following are the basic commands i learnt:
* cd: change directory(to open a directory)
* mkdir: make directory
* ls: list( to list all files and directories present in current directory)
* touch: to create a new file
* cat: concatenate(can be used to read one file or even concatenate two or more files and read them)

#                        Task 17: Intro to VR


# AR/VR - A mini Study
### Rehan Luke Jacob | UVCE Marvel R&D| Level 0: Task 17

## Virtual Reality
Virtual reality is basically the technology that provides a fully immersive, computer-generated 3D environment. With the aid of special devices like VR headsets, motion controllers, etc we, the users can explore the digital worlds created just as like if we were present there.  Virtual reality is currently used in gaming, simulations and heavily used in fields like medical training. 

## Augmented Reality
Augmented reality, on the other hand helps enhance the real world by add digital objects, effects or other such elements into our (the users) environment(surrounding). Augmented reality can be accessed using just our mobile phones, tablets or AR glasses like the **Apple vision Pro**.


The apple vision pro is a mix of AR and VR. The Apple vision pro replicates our environment using sensors and cameras on a digital display inside the vision pro and therefore implements the AR part of it where all apps and software seem to hover right in front of our eyes.
And since the vision pro is basically a VR headset, as opposed to the prototype of the Oculus which was just a VR headset with no AR capabilities. With the vision pro (or the meta quest 3 even), we can simulate our physical environment on the digital display within it using the camera sensors on it and the OS within adds 3d virtual elements to it. It can also repurpose the digital display to act as a complete VR headset.

## Classification of AR and VR:

![](https://github.com/Rehanljacob/Marvel-Level-0-/blob/main/vr%20classification.jpg?raw=true)

Extended reality: Whatever we are projecting outside our laptop

Mixed reality is a mix of virtual reality in the augmented reality. 


## Difference between VR and AR
There are numerous differences between the two. The main difference lies in its level of immersion. VR transports the user to a completely different virtual environment, whereas AR lies in the same physical environment as the user, but adds virtual 3d elements to our space. 
Another difference between the two is the fact that VR relies mainly on dedicated headsets to be mounted on our head, whereas AR can be accessed even with just our mobile phones or smart glasses.



## Trends in the Space

The first time I was hooked on to the idea of VR/AR was after I watched the film named **Ready Player One**, a sci-fi movie set in the future, directed by well-known director Steven Spielberg. The movie was set in 2045 and revolved around OASIS; an VR world created solely for humans to escape their mundane lives. OASIS was a universe with multiple worlds and games and most of humanity lived, worked and played in the OASIS.
At the time when I watched the movie (2018), a concept like OASIS was completely out of the realm of possibility. Although now, with the advent of goggles like the oculus, apple vision pro and other such exciting tools, OASIS might just be closer than we expect. 
In fact the metaverse from meta, is basically the OASIS in its rudimentary phase. According to wired.com(https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-the-metaverse/): “The metaverse is a speculative concept for a future internet, initially tied to consumer VR but shifting towards industrial applications.”
AR/VR is also rapidly growing in the field of architecture. Recently, I had the privilege of participating in an AR/VR workshop at BMS college of Architecture, where we were exposed to the wide scope of augmented and virtual reality in the sphere of Architecture. 
Traditionally, architecture relied on 2D drawings and static 3D models, which often limited a client’s ability to fully understand the scale and feel of a project. AR/VR solves this issue by aiding in creating the visual prototype of a building or real estate thereby increasing the efficiency of workload for the architects. VR also allows for immersive walkthroughs of buildings before construction, helping clients and architects grasp a better idea of scale and layout realistically. 
In conclusion, these tools help reduce design errors, save costs and adds to the credibility of the project.

## Tech stack used:
* Development engines: Unity 3D, Unreal engine 5
* Language: C++, C#, Python
* AR frameworks: WebAR, ARCore(Google), Arkit(apple), VisionOS(Vision pro operating system)
* 3D modelling: Blender, Cinema4D
* Devices: Meta Quest (originally Oculus), Microsoft Hololens, Apple Vision Pro, Smartphones

## Indian companies in the Space:
* Tesseract (acquired by Jio): focus on AR/VR hardware and solutions
* SmartVizX: develops VR platforms for architecture, real estate visualisation
* Scapic (acquired by flipkart): AR solutions for e-commerce
* AjnaLens: designs AR/VR headsets for education, defence, etc
* Gametion: Exploring immersive gaming opportunities
